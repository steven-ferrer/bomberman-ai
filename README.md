# Bomberman AI
#### Evolving AI using Genetic Programming Technique applied to Bomberman. 

> The game is currently on development. Anyone can pull a request if you found a bug or you want to optimize the game.
> You can also clone the repository and use it to your own projects (credit to me).
> Our aim is to implement the algorithms in this game such as A* pathfinding for Aggressive and Defensive behavior of Predefined-AI and Evolving AI using Genetic algorithm

 You can check our documentation included to this repository to know more about the artificial intelligence for bomberman game and our main objectives.

# About the game
## Objectives
The aim of this study is to develop an algorithm using Genetic Programming Technique for evolving AI in the game Bomberman. 
It is also aimed to implement other AI agents using pre-defined heuristic in order to improve the skills of Evolving AI. 
Specifically, it is aimed to achieve the following objectives: 

- To design an algorithm using Genetic Programming Technique for the Evolving AI. 
- To apply the pathfinding algorithm for other agents that can be used to their behavior. 
- To implement a simple Bomberman platform for the game environment of the AIs. 
- To test the efficiency and improvements of the algorithm than the other agents

## Software Requirements
- [Unity 2017.20f3](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-2017.2.0) 
- Monodevelop (`included in Unity`)

## Game Environment
The game is from the tutorials [How to Make a Game Like Bomberman](https://www.raywenderlich.com/125559/make-game-like-bomberman) by [Eric Van de Kerckhove](https://www.raywenderlich.com/u/blackdragonbe). Thanks a lot to him for the Starter Project of Bomberman

### Features
I added new features of the game does not in the tutorials such as:
- Destructible Walls (`can be destroy by bomb explosion`)
- Max Bomb (`limit the bombs can be drop`)
- Auto Generated Map (`generate a random destructible walls on map`)
