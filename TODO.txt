<Game Environment>
- Automatic Map Generator *
- Separate Holders for Blocks, floors and walls *
- Player Movements *
- Bomb Position Placement for Collider (bugs) *
- Chain Reaction for Bombs *
- Dynamic Code movements for Agents (C#) *
- Player collision on explosion (dead + winning agents) *
- Limit the bomb range and maximum drop bomb of all agents *
- Explosion Size to prevent die into small gap spacing (bugs) *
- Bomb placement duplicate gameobject in same tile (bugs) *
- Sountrack for Explosion *
- Explode Destructible Walls *
- Can't place bomb in the recentPosition (bugs) *
- Particle System (bugs) *
- Pushing Back Agents (Bugs) *
- Destructible wall place also in the same position of Indestructible wall (bugs) *
- Time countdown when less than 30seconds. the map will shrink 
- Store safeplace into list then randomize to place the position of player

<A* Pathfinding Algorithm>
- Implementation of Grid and Node from Game World *
- Separate Destructible and Unwalkable wall (update) *
- Converted Diagonal distance into Manhattan Distance (4 Direction) *
- Optimized Pathfinding algorithm using Heap *
